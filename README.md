This board comes with conflicting goals: 

- To be as affordable as possible
- To be as low as possible

You can have JLCPCB assemble it for you from the files in jlcpcb/production_files. If you want the 3305-0s placed, you will need to provide the 3305-0-15-80-47-27-10-0 receptacles and the 0906-2-15-20-75-14-11-0 pogo pins via consignment, as well as switch the other parts to global order parts. All components are top placed to make the board as low as possible, and also to make fabrication cheaper. 

If you're hand soldering, SOD-323 diodes should fit on the 0805 smd pads fine and are easier to get on Amazon.
