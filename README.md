# Swoon Half Xiao'd

A diode matrix rework of the Sweep Half Swept for Seeed Xiao nRF52840. 

Use with [301020 10mm x 22mm x 3mm](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806150189359.html) with jst-SH 1.0mm 2 pin connector.


This board comes with conflicting goals: 

- To be as affordable as possible
- To be as low as possible

You can have JLCPCB assemble it for you from the files in jlcpcb/production_files, but you will need to provide the 3305-0-15-80-47-27-10-0 receptacles and the 0906-2-15-20-75-14-11-0 pogo pins via consignment. All components are top placed to make the board as low as possible, and also to make fabrication cheaper.
